# linear_regression_model
I recently completed a hands-on Machine Learning project where I designed, trained, and evaluated a Linear Regression model using Python, following the end-to-end ML pipeline.

🔹 Project Highlights:

Performed data cleaning and preprocessing

Applied feature scaling using MinMaxScaler

Built and trained a Linear Regression model with scikit-learn

Split data into training and testing sets

Evaluated model performance using standard regression metrics

🔹 Model Performance:
📉 MAE: 1.66 × 10⁻⁵
📉 MSE: 4.35 × 10⁻¹⁰
📉 RMSE: 2.09 × 10⁻⁵
📊 R² Score: 0.999999981

🔹 Tech Stack Used:

Python

NumPy & Pandas

Scikit-learn

Google Colab

GitHub

This project helped strengthen my understanding of regression models, data preprocessing, and performance evaluation in real-world machine learning workflows. Looking forward to applying these skills to more advanced projects! 🚀
